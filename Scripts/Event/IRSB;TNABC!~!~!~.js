//Purpose: To prevent inspections being completed before Investigative Review and Citizenship Verification is completed.

//Step 1: We need to pull current active workflow status from the cap. We most likely need to use a Javadoc function.
//Step 1a: Get Task Object:

//No need to iterate if we know the first 2 workflow tasks are the ones we need. Selecting first and second index.
var invRevDesc = aa.workflow.getTasks(capId).getOutput()[0].getTaskItem().getTaskDescription();
var invRevActive = aa.workflow.getTasks(capId).getOutput()[0].getTaskItem().getActiveFlag();
var citiDesc = aa.workflow.getTasks(capId).getOutput()[1].getTaskItem().getTaskDescription();
var citiActive = aa.workflow.getTasks(capId).getOutput()[1].getTaskItem().getActiveFlag();

//Step 2: Check to see if status is active
if (invRevDesc == "Investigative Review" && invRevActive == 'Y' || citiDesc == "Citizenship Verification" && citiActive == 'Y') {
	cancel = true;
	showMessage = true;
	comment("Inspections cannot be completed before Investigative Review/Citizenship Verification is completed in the workflow.");

}
